Set Workflows
=============

In the INNUENDO Platform, Workflows are the merge of one or more
protocols to build a cascade of events to be applied to you strains. Their
goal is to organize a group of software to be applied and you can then apply
multiple workflows to a strain and build a pipeline according to their specific
**Workflow dependencies**.

As for Protocols, Workflows also have a predifined set of attributes that
need to be filled in order to be successfully applied to a strain. A workflow
must have a **Name**, a **Dependency**, a **Type**, and the **Species**
where that workflow will be available.

Workflow Name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each workflow **MUST** have a name.
